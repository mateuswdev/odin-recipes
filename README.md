This project helped my getting down the key concepts of HTML.

Putting to test the abilities thought on the program gave me a better understanding of it. I feel more confident navigating through directory structures and linking them correctly, putting in practice the use of bold and italic also gives you a better understanding of what they are meant for.

You will also get to do your first few git commits and it may show you how valuable a good commit is.
