        <h2>Brazilian White Rice</h2>
        <p>White rice is the main side dish made in Brazil. This is the way my mom would make it and taught my brother and I. What makes this so different is that we fry it in oil with minced onion and garlic before adding water. You can also use part water, part chicken broth. <em>The secret is to not let it overcook</em> because it should come out loose and not sticky.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 cups hot water</li>
        </ul>
