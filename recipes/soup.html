        <h2>Chunky Vegetarian Vegetable Soup</h2>
        <p>I make this super-easy vegetarian vegetable soup about every other week. It's thick and hearty, almost like a stew. Served with warm whole grain bread it makes a filling meal. Use green peas or green peas in place of okra if preferred.</p>
